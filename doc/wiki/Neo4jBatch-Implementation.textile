@Neo4jBatchGraph@ provides support for the bulk insertion of data into a "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org graph. This Blueprints implementation is single-threaded and non-transactional. It is meant for initial dumps of raw data into a Neo4j graph and is much faster than doing the equivalent process using @Neo4jGraph@ (see [[Neo4j Implementation]]).

*Note*: This is not a pure Blueprints implementation.  Consider the following issues when using @Neo4jBatchGraph@:

# Delete methods (except for @Element.removeProperty()@) are not supported.
# There are no default @Index.VERTICES@ and @Index.EDGES@ indices created at startup.
# The Neo4j "reference node" (vertex 0) is not automagically deleted upon graph creation.

Unlike @Neo4jGraph@, and like @TinkerGraph@, @Neo4jBatchGraph@ can accept a @long@ id on vertex creation:

```java
long id = 1L;
graph.addVertex(id)
```

When utilizing @Neo4jBatchGraph@ it is important to make use of the @flush@ method on @Neo4jBatchIndex@. This method must be called before querying the index for data to ensure that it returns results consistently. This method is not a standard @Index@ API method and thus, be sure to typecast the index to @Neo4jBatchIndex@.  Note that calling @flush@ (and using indices in general) has a noticeable impact on the performance when writing to the graph. Finally, see @Neo4jBatchGraph.flushIndices()@ for flushing all indices at once.
