TinkerGraph is a lightweight, "POJO":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object based, in-memory property graph that serves as the reference implementation for the [[property graph model]]. If you have a small graph that can be loaded and saved using the [[GraphML reader and writer library]], then TinkerGraph can be handy to use. There are no dependency requirements to use TinkerGraph as it comes packaged with the Blueprints distribution.

```java
Graph graph = new TinkerGraph();
```

There is a hardcoded representation of the graph diagrammed in [[Property Graph Model]]. This is useful as a small, play dataset to get acquainted with the Blueprints API.

```java
Graph graph = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph();
```
