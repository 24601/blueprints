This section will provide a collection of basic code examples that work with the Blueprints graph API. The in-memory [[TinkerGraph]] database will be used throughout the examples. Please feel free to alter the graph constructor to work with different graph databases.

h2(#create). Create a Simple Graph

Create a graph. Add two vertices. Set the @name@ property of each vertex. Create an @knows@ edge between the two vertices. Print the components of the graph.

```java
import com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.tg.TinkerGraph;
import com.tinkerpop.blueprints.Graph;
import com.tinkerpop.blueprints.Vertex;
import com.tinkerpop.blueprints.Edge;
import com.tinkerpop.blueprints.Direction;

Graph graph = new TinkerGraph();
Vertex a = graph.addVertex(null);
Vertex b = graph.addVertex(null);
a.setProperty("name", "marko");
b.setProperty("name", "peter");
Edge e = graph.addEdge(null, a, b, "knows");
System.out.println(e.getVertex(Direction.OUT).getProperty("name") + "--" + e.getLabel() + "-->" + e.getVertex(Direction.IN).getProperty("name"));
```

The @System.out@ after the code executes is:

bc. marko--knows-->peter

<a name="elements"></a>

h2(#elements). Iterate through the Elements of a Graph

Load the TinkerPop play graph diagrammed in [[Property Graph Model]]. Iterate through all the vertices and print them to @System.out@. Iterate through all the edges and print them to @System.out@.

```java
public void testIteratingGraph() {
  Graph graph = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph();
  System.out.println("Vertices of " + graph);
  for (Vertex vertex : graph.getVertices()) {
    System.out.println(vertex);
  }
  System.out.println("Edges of " + graph);
  for (Edge edge : graph.getEdges()) {
    System.out.println(edge);
   }
}
```

The @System.out@ after the code executes is:

bc. Vertices of tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]
v[3]
v[2]
v[1]
v[6]
v[5]
v[4]
Edges of tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]
e[10][4-created->5]
e[7][1-knows->2]
e[9][1-created->3]
e[8][1-knows->4]
e[11][4-created->3]
e[12][6-created->3]

<a name="edge"></a>

h2(#edge). Iterate through the Edges of a Vertex

Load the TinkerPop play graph diagrammed in [[Property Graph Model]]. Get vertex @1@ from the graph by its @id@. Print some information about the vertex. Iterate through the outgoing edges of the vertex and print the edges.

```java
Graph graph = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph();
Vertex a = graph.getVertex("1");
System.out.println("vertex " + a.getId() + " has name " + a.getProperty("name"));
for(Edge e : a.getEdges(OUT)) {
  System.out.println(e);
}
```

The @System.out@ after the code executes is:

bc. vertex 1 has name marko
e[7][1-knows->2]
e[9][1-created->3]
e[8][1-knows->4]

<a name="index"></a>
