@BatchGraph@ wraps any @TransactionalGraph@ to enable batch loading of a large number of edges and vertices by chunking the entire load into smaller batches and maintaining a memory-efficient vertex cache so that intermediate transactional states can be flushed after each chunk is loaded to release memory.


@BatchGraph@ is *ONLY* meant for loading data and does not support any retrieval or removal operations. That is, BatchGraph only supports the following methods:
* @addVertex()@ for adding vertices
* @addEdge()@ for adding edges
* @getVertex()@ to be used when adding edges
* Property getter, setter and removal methods for vertices and edges as well as @getId()@

An important limitation of @BatchGraph@ is that edge properties can only be set immediately after the edge has been added. If other vertices or edges have been created in the meantime, setting, getting or removing properties will throw exceptions. This is done to avoid caching of edges which would require a great amount of memory.

@BatchGraph@ wraps @TransactionalGraph@. To wrap arbitrary graphs, use @BatchGraph.wrap()@ which will additionally wrap non-transactional graphs.

@BatchGraph@ can also automatically set the provided element ids as properties on the respective element. Use @setVertexIdKey()@ and @setEdgeIdKey()@ to set the keys for the vertex and edge properties respectively. This is useful when the graph implementation ignores supplied ids and allows to make the loaded graph compatible for later wrapping with @IdGraph@ (see [[Id Implementation]]) when setting the vertex and edge Id keys to @IdGraph.ID@.

As an example, suppose we are loading a large number of edges defined by a String array with four entries called _quads_:

# The out vertex id
# The in vertex id
# The label of the edge
# A string annotation for the edge, i.e. an edge property

Assuming this array is very large, loading all these edges in a single transaction is likely to exhaust main memory. Furthermore,
one would have to rely on the database indexes to retrieve previously created vertices for a given id. @BatchGraph@ addresses
both of these issues.

```java
BatchGraph bgraph = new BatchGraph(graph, BatchGraph.IdType.STRING, 1000);
for (String[] quad : quads) {
    Vertex[] vertices = new Vertex[2];
    for (int i=0;i<2;i++) {
        vertices[i] = bgraph.getVertex(quad[i]);
        if (vertices[i]==null) vertices[i]=bgraph.addVertex(quad[i]);
    }
    Edge edge = bgraph.addEdge(null,vertices[0],vertices[1],quad[2]);
    edge.setProperty("annotation",quad[3]);
}
```

First, a @BatchGraph@ _bgraph_ is created wrapping an existing _graph_ and setting the id type to @IdType.STRING@ and the batch size to 1000.
@BatchGraph@ maintains a mapping from the external vertex ids, in our example the first two entries in the String array describing th edge,
to the internal vertex ids assigned by the wrapped grahp database. Since this mapping is maintained in memory, it is potentially much faster
than the database index. By specifying the @IdType@, @BatchGraph@ chooses the most memory-efficient mapping data structure and applies compression
algorithms if possible. There are four different @IdTypes@:

* _OBJECT_ : For arbitrary object vertex ids. This is the most generic and least space efficient type.
* _STRING_ : For string vertex ids. Attempts to apply string compression and prefixing strategies to reduce the memory footprint.
* _URL_ : For string vertex ids that parse as URLs. Applies URL specific compression schemes that are more efficient than generic string compression.
* _NUMBER_ : For numeric vertex ids. Uses primitive data structures that requires significantly less memory.

The last argument in the constructor is the batch size, that is, the number of vertices and edges to load before committing a transaction and starting a
new one.

The for-loop then iterates over all the quad String arrays and creates an edge for each by first retrieving or creating the vertex end points
and then creating the edge. Note, that we set the edge property immediately after creating the edge. This is required because
edges are only kept in memory until the next edge is created for efficiency reasons.

h2. Incremental Loading

The above describes how @BatchGraph@ can be used to load data into a graph under the assumption that the wrapped graph is initially empty. @BatchGraph@ can also be used to incrementally batch load edges and vertices into a graph with existing data. In this case, vertices may already exist for given ids.

If the wrapped graph does not ignore ids, then enabling incremental batch loading is as simple as calling @setLoadingFromScratch(false)@, i.e. to disable the assumption that data is loaded into an empty graph. If the wrapped graph does ignore ids, then one has to tell @BatchGraph@ how to find existing vertices for a given id by specifying the vertex id key using @setVertexIdKey(uid)@ where _uid_ is some string for the property key. Also, uid must be "key indexed":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Graph-Indices for this to work.

```java
graph.createKeyIndex("uid",Vertex.class);
BatchGraph bgraph = new BatchGraph(graph, BatchGraph.IdType.STRING, 1000);
bgraph.setVertexIdKey("uid);
bgraph.setLoadingFromScratch(false);
//Load data as shown above
```

Note, that incremental batch loading is more expensive than loading from scratch because @BatchGraph@ has to call on the wrapped graph to determine whether a vertex exists for a given id.
